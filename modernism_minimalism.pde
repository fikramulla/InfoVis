//"A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and 
//social traditions, which often led to experiments with form, along with the use of techniques that 
//drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting, poem, building, etc.
//Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism and makes use of the works of the past by the 
//employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody." - wikipedia
