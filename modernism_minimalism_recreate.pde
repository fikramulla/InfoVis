//"A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and 
//social traditions, which often led to experiments with form, along with the use of techniques that 
//drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting, poem, building, etc.
//Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism and makes use of the works of the past by the 
//employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody." - wikipedia

// my inspiration for this is my hometown and the minimalism aspect of modernism from the wiki description above.
// i tried to incorporate reprise and recapitulation from works of the past (cars/vehicles) to recreate the painting with 
// a present/futuristic/minimalist vision of what "cars/vehicles" are/will be like in the near future - electricity.  
// thus, the minimalist/modernist factory of the future just needs to mass produce and mass sell energy (batteries?).
// i input an image an image of a lightning bolt to represent this
